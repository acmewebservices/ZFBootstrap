# Zend Framework bootstrap

This is a basic project setup using several technologies in a usable state. Currently it features

- [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) 1.9.6
- [ZFDebug](http://code.google.com/p/zfdebug/) 1.5
- [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) (Doctrine AND vendor folder) 1.2.1

This setup is based upon the [ZFDebugDoctrine](http://github.com/danceric/zfdebugdoctrine) project.
